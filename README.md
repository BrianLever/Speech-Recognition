# BM WpfClient 

This project is the new client (WPF) for the BlueMaria and Google Cloud Speech API 
([Google Cloud Speech API](http://cloud.google.com/speech)).

## Build and Run

1.  **Follow the instructions in the [root README](../../README.md)**.

2.  Open VS, go to 'Team/Manage Connections' (from the menu), that should open the Team Explorer.

3.  There is 'local Git repositories' section at the bottom of that window  
    (pin it down so it doesn't hide, it's always on the right side bar if it does).  
    click the 'Clone', you'll get 2 text boxes underneath

4.  Click the 'Clone', and you should get 2 text boxes underneath

5.  Use this repository link https://bitbucket.org/bluemaria/bm.wpfclient.git for 'URL of a GIT repo',  
    leave 'recursively' checked and click 'Clone'.
    
6.  It's going to ask you for credentials for bitbucket (username, pass),  
    then wait for it to clone and copy the files to that local path, it's pretty fast, small I think.
    
7.  It opens up a 'directory' of the solution in the 'solution explorer', pin that down so it won't go away, for now.  
    There's a hyperlink (yellowish text) saying 'Solutions and Folders', click that,  
    then select 'Stwin.sln' to load the solution.
    
8.  Right click on the 'BlueMaria' project and 'set as a startup project' (if not already), it should become bold.

9.  Build the Solution.

10.  The necessary files should already be in the bin/Debug folder. 

11.  We're now using the 'master' branch, so no need to go to the 'Branches' and change anything there, just clone. 
      ```  
      ```
